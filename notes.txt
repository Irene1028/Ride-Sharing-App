Maybe use RID so website/type/RID? (website/owner/RID, website/driver/RID, website/share/RID)

Need to have SEPARATE pNum for owner's group and total owner+share

website/login
website/register
website/main_page --> website/type

website/owner/new_request - generate ride request
website/owner/RID - loading page until trigger from open --> confirm, display driver w/ RID info when confirm
website/owner/RID/edit - show new_request with filled info for RID --> allow edit and cancel or fail if status =/= open, RID maintained since not confirmed yet (must lock if status =/= open)

website/vehicle - allow name change, PW change, vehicle registry
website/driver - check if vehicle exists
website/driver/register - subpage to register if vehicle DNE
website/driver/search - search with vehicle info for valid owners
website/driver/RID - when select from search get RID + info from owner, complete button, set ALL RID to confirm, can move back to register --> drop/edit driver row

website/share/new_request - generate share request
website/share/search - search with share info for valid owners
website/share/RID - when select from search get RID + info from owner, add to pNum for owner, sync status to owner's status (show same page)
website/share/RID/edit - new_request with filled info for RID --> must drop RID and search again


Might want to add separate history table --> ensure vehicle info manitained if driver changes
FK username | RID | type (driver/owner/share) | plate | vehicle type | SVI | pNum (actual number) | address | time confirm | time complete
